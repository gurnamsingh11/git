git remote will list the remote connections you have

git remote -v will list the remote connections along with their URL.

Add or remove remote repositeries:
git remote add <name> <url>
git remote rm <name>

Hiding files:

creating a file called .gitignore at the root of Git repository then we can define patterns:

Mypasswords.txt
- Ignores this specific file

directory_name/
- Ignores everything in this directory

*.sql
- Ignores anything ending with .sql

VS Code:

Accounts > Turn on settings > Sign in > github

source control > here we can directly commit

three dots -> add remote -> add repo link with token
