<h1>Git Diff</h1>

<h2>Understanding Git Diff Syntax</h2>
<p>The <code>git diff</code> command shows the differences between files or commits. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax for the diff output:</p>
<pre>
diff --git a/my_file.txt b/my_file.txt
index a163a61..622f819 100644
--- a/my_file.txt
+++ b/my_file.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 ONE LINE
 TWO LINE
-THREE LINE
\ No newline at end of file
+THREE LINE
+For
\ No newline at end of file
</pre>

<p>In the diff output:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> represent the versions being compared.</li>
  <li><code>---</code> denotes the old version (committed version).</li>
  <li><code>+++</code> denotes the new version (updated version).</li>
  <li>The lines beginning with <code>-</code> are removed from the old version.</li>
  <li>The lines beginning with <code>+</code> are added in the new version.</li>
  <li>Lines not prefixed by <code>-</code> or <code>+</code> show unchanged context.</li>
</ul>
