we can check for remote branches with the command:
git remote -v

If you run thhis command on a cloned repo you will view the URL of the remote branch, like the Github URL.

If there is no connection to a remote branch, then you wont see a URL.

After creating a repo locally we need to create the repo on Github.

Once created the repo on Github you will see the instructions under: ".. or push an existing repo from command line"

we tell git we want to add a remote branch using git remote :
git remote add name https://url.git

By convention we call this remote branch the origin branch

git remote add origin https://url.git

You then replace the .git URL with the .git URL from the repo you created.

Few commands:
git remote rename <old> <new>
git remote remove <name>

Push:

we tell git to push to the remote main/master branch called origin with the command:
git push -u origin main/master
