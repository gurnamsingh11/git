git checkout
A "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity.

The git checkout command can operate on three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.

For example, you could use git checkout branch_name instead of git switch branch_name to checkout a new branch.

Unlike git switch however, recall checkout can operate on commits, meaning we can "checkout" historical commits.

we can check out a particular commit by specifying its hash, we can get hashes from the git log command and we can also see the abbreviated hash using:
git log --online

Then we can provide the has as:
git checkout ####### (first seven)

This command does not UNDO previous work, simply exploring historical commits
